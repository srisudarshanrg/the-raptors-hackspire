## Problem Statement
- For ordering food on a daily basis, or even occasionally, every student has to go through a big hassle. We have to seek permission in our class group, send a message to the canteen and get money the next day. 
- This problem not only applies to our canteen but even to our assignments which teachers send online. We may miss them, or not realize the date of submission or so.
  

## Solution
We have created an app with the dual purpose of solving both these problems:
- Canteen Buddy:
  - An app called Canteen Buddy lets the canteen stuff update the menu on a daily basis.
  - Using the menu, the students can place orders if the item they order is available.
  - The canteen stuff can then view individual orders as well as orders of a particular item by a particular section. The number of items ordered by a section is also displayed, making it easy for the canteen staff to know how many plates of each item has to be delivered to each section.
- Assignment Tracker:
  - Using this app, teachers can send assignments to the students and also modify them.
  - The students will also be able to view the assignments sent by a teacher
